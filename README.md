# Statistics-Cheatz
Calculators for statistics homework


This project is a collection of python calculators used for solving statistics problems. You can find all of these calculators online, but hopefully this will be easier to find in one place. I'm pretty new to github, so I'm pretty sure you can edit my source code, but I am asking that you don't edit the source code for my own sanity.
